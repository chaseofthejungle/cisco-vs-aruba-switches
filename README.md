# Cisco Meraki vs. Aruba Switches Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Choosing a networking switch platform is a crucial matter of performance, security, scalability, data flow, general interface connectivity, and overall reliability. This is a matter that organizations hope to get right the first time, as networking implementation impacts both short-term and long-term sustainability and growth (and not always predictably). This guide discusses two particular switching platform lines: Cisco's Meraki and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) Arbuba Networks subsidiary. A decision has to be made, should these be the two candidates for organizational switching: should advanced features, security, and a lighter learning curve be prioritized over cost-consciousness and flexible customizations?
