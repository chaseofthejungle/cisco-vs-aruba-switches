# Cisco Meraki vs. Aruba Switches Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Choosing a networking switch platform is a crucial matter of performance, security, scalability, data flow, general interface connectivity, and overall reliability. This is a matter that organizations hope to get right the first time, as networking implementation impacts both short-term and long-term sustainability and growth (and not always predictably). This guide discusses two particular switching platform lines: Cisco's Meraki and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) Arbuba Networks subsidiary. A decision has to be made, should these be the two candidates for organizational switching: should advanced features, security, and a lighter learning curve be prioritized over cost-consciousness and flexible customizations?

Some significant differences between Cisco Meraki and Aruba switches include:

| *Consideration* | *Cisco Meraki* | *Aruba* |
| :---: | :---: | :----: |
| Management Model | Entirely cloud-based. | Hybrid model (options for on-premises, cloud-based, and controller-less deployments. |
| Affordability | Subscription-based licensing (potentially high total cost of ownership). | Not all deployments require subscriptions, and some non-cloud products are less costly. Licensing handled via Aruba Central dashboard. |
| Configuration | Largely pre-configured for low learning curve and easy usage. Some configurations available via Meraki's dashboard. | Granular configurations and deployments with complex features are more inherently plausible, with a command line interface also readily available. |
